// *************** THE 7 PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES ***************

    Boolean: logical type that can be only true or false
    Undefined: value taken by a variable that that is yet not defined ('empty value')
    Null: empty value also (voluntary, generally speaking when you see a null value its because someone setted it)
    Symbol: a value that is unique and cannot be changed (not very used)
